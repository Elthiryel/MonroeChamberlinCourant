\label{cha:preliminaries}

In the first part of this chapter we explain basic notions regarding multiwinner elections. Next, we present definitions of winner determination problems under Monroe and Chamberlin-Courant (CC) voting rules. Finally, we present some notions regarding approximation algorithms for these tasks.

\section{Basic Notions}

In this section we present essential definitions and notions concerning multiwinner elections.
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 1: Preferences \cite{1}}. \hspace{.1in} Let's assume we have $n$ agents (representing voters in the elections) and $m$ alternatives (representing candidates in the elections). For each agent $i$, her \textit{preference order} is a strict linear order $\succ_{i}$ over all the alternatives that ranks them from the most to the least desirable one. Collection $V$ of the preference orders of all the agents is called a \textit{preference profile}.
\\

If $A$ is the set of all the alternatives and $B$ is a nonempty strict subset of $A$, then by $B \succ A - B$ we mean that all alternatives in $B$ are preferred to those outside of $B$ for the preference order $\succ$.
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 2: Positional scoring function \cite{1}.} \hspace{.1in} Let's assume we have $m$ alternatives and function $\alpha^{m}: \{1,...,m\} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ that assigns an integer value to each position in the agent's preference order. If $\alpha^{m}$ is a decreasing function (for each $i, j \in \{1,...,m\}$, $i > j \implies \alpha^{m}(i) < \alpha^{m}(j)$), it is called a \textit{satisfaction function} and it can represent an agent's satisfaction when an alternative from a particular position in her preference order is elected. For every satisfaction function $\alpha^{m}(m) = 0$, so an agent is not satisfied at all with her worst alternative. In some cases, we will write $\alpha$ instead of $\alpha^{m}$ to simplify notation.
\\

A satisfaction function  $\alpha^{m}$ is a \textit{linear satisfaction function} if for each $i \in \{1,...,m-1\}$ value $\alpha^{m}(i+1) - \alpha^{m}(i)$ is constant. Every satisfaction function not satisfying this constraint is a \textit{nonlinear satisfaction function}.
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 3: Assignment functions \cite{1}.} \hspace{.1in} Let's assume we have $n$ agents and $m$ alternatives. Let $B$ be a set of all the agents ($B = \{1,...,n\}$). A \textit{K-assignment function} $\Phi: B \rightarrow \{a_{1},...,a_{m}\}$ is a function that assigns a single alternative to every agent in such way, that no more than $K$ alternatives are selected ($\norm{\Phi(B)} \leq K$). It is called a \textit{Monroe K-assignment function} if it additionally satisfies the following constraint: For each alternative $a$ we have that either $\left\lfloor \frac{\norm{B}}{K} \right\rfloor \leq \norm{\Phi^{-1}(a)} \leq \left\lceil \frac{\norm{B}}{K} \right\rceil$ or $\norm{\Phi^{-1}(a)} = 0$. It means that for Monroe K-assignment function, agents are assigned to exactly $K$ alternatives and each of the alternatives has about $\frac{\norm{B}}{K}$ agents assigned. If we have an assignment function $\Phi$, alternative $\Phi(i)$ is called the \textit{representative} of agent $i$.
\\

Additionally, if we allow the K-assignment function to assign an empty alternative ($\bot$) to the agents, it is called a \textit{partial K-assignment function}. It is also a \textit{partial Monroe K-assignment function} if it can be extended to a regular Monroe K-assignment function by replacing all the empty alternatives with the regular alternatives ($\{a_{1},...,a_{m}\}$).
\\

Let $S$ be a set of alternatives. By $\Phi^{S}$ we mean a K-assignment function (or a partial K-assignment function) that assigns agents only to alternatives from $S$.
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 4: Total satisfaction function \cite{1}.} \hspace{.1in} We assume that $\alpha$ is a satisfaction function and $pos_{i}(x)$ represents position of alternative $x$ in the $i$'th agent's preference order. The following function assigns a positive integer to a given assignment $\Phi$:
\begin{gather}
	l^{\alpha}_{sum}(\Phi) = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \alpha (pos_{i}(\Phi(i)))
\end{gather}
This function combines satisfaction of the agents to assess the quality of the assignment for the entire society. It simply calculates the sum of the individual agents' satisfaction value and is used as the \textit{total satisfaction function}.
\\

For each subset of the alternatives $S \subseteq A$ that satisfies $\norm{S} \leq K$, by $\Phi^{S}_{\alpha}$ we mean the partial K-assignment (or the partial Monroe K-assignment) that assigns agents only to the alternatives from $S$ and such that $\Phi^{S}_{\alpha}$ maximizes the total satisfaction $l^{\alpha}_{sum}(\Phi^{S}_{\alpha})$.

\section{Monroe and Chamberlin-Courant Rules}

We will now define the problems of winner determination under the Monroe and CC rules. The goal is to find an optimal assignment function, where by the optimal function we understand one that maximizes the total satisfaction.
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 5: Chamberlin-Courant and Monroe problems \cite{1}.} \hspace{.1in}  Let's assume we have $n$ agents, $m$ alternatives, preference profile $V$, $K \in \mathbb{N}$ ($K < m$) representing the committee size and a satisfaction function $\alpha$. The goal of the \textit{Chamberlin-Courant problem} is to find a K-assignment function $\Phi$ for which the total satisfaction $l^{\alpha}_{sum}(\Phi)$ is maximal under preference profile $V$. The goal of the \textit{Monroe problem} is the same, but it searches for a Monroe K-assignment function instead.
\\

Intention of solving these problems is to find a (Monroe) K-assignment function which returns a set of $K$ alternatives, who are viewed as the winners of the given multiwinner election (e.g. elected members of a committee).

\section{Approximate Solutions}

As for many satisfaction functions multiwinner election problems under both Monroe and CC rules are NP-hard \cite{3, 4, 2}, we are looking for approximate solutions.
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 6: Approximation algorithms \cite{1}.} \hspace{.1in} Let $r$ be a real number such that $0 < r \leq 1$, let $\alpha$ be a satisfaction function. An algorithm is an \textit{r-approximation algorithm} for CC or Monroe problem if for every correct input it returns an assignment $\Phi$ such that $l^{\alpha}_{sum}(\Phi) \geq r \cdot OPT$, where $OPT$ is the optimal total satisfaction $l^{\alpha}_{sum}(\Phi_{max})$.
\\

\section{State of the Art}

The Chamberlin-Courant and Monroe multiwinner voting rules were introduced by Chamberlin and Courant \cite{9} and Monroe \cite{8} respectively. Despite having desired properties of multiwinner rules when we want to achieve a proportional representation \cite{10}, there has not been much research regarding these systems yet.

Complexity of both of these systems was studied in several papers and the conclusion is that they are both NP-hard. Procaccia et al. \cite{2} showed that these systems are NP-hard in the dissatisfaction-based framework in case of approval dissatisfaction function, Lu and Boutilier \cite{4} presented hardness for the Chamberlin-Courant rule under linear satisfaction function, while Betzler et al. \cite{3} studied the parameterized complexity of the rules. There were also papers that studied the complexity for some specific cases where preferences are either single-peaked (Yu et al. \cite{11}) or single-crossing (Skowron et al. \cite{12}).

Lu and Boutilier \cite{4} were the first to study the approximability of the Chamberlin-Courant rules under linear satisfaction function, and they presented an approximation algorithm for this case. Skowron et al. \cite{1} gave more approximation algorithms for both the Monroe and Chamberlin-Courant rules (for the linear satisfaction function) and assessed their effectiveness against various data sets. Faliszewski et al. \cite{14} were the first to show results for nonlinear satisfaction functions other then the approval ones, using algorithms based on voter clustering.

We discuss the algorithms of Skowron et al. \cite{2} and Lu and Boutilier \cite{4} in the next section.
