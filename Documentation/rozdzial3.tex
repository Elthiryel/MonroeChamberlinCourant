\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{cha:preliminaries}

In the first part of the chapter we explain basic notions regarding multiwinner election problem. Next, we present definitions of winner determination problem under the Monroe and Chamberlin-Courant voting rules. Finally, we present some notions regarding approximate solutions to the problem.

\section{Basic Notions}

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 1: Preferences. \cite{1}} \hspace{.1in} For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, by $[n]$ we mean $\left\{ 1, \ldots, n \right\}$. We assume that there is a set $N = [n]$ of \textit{agents} and a set $A = \left\{ a_{1}, \ldots a_{m} \right\}$ of \textit{alternatives}. Each agent $i$ has a strict linear order $\succ_{i}$ over $A$, called \textit{preference order} ($a_{\pi(1)} \succ_{i} a_{\pi(2)} \succ_{i} \ldots \succ_{i} a_{\pi(m)}$ for some permutation $\pi$ of $[m]$). For an alternative $a$, $pos_{i}(a)$ represents the position of $a$ in the preference order of agent $i$. For example, if $a$ is the most preferred alternative for $i$ then $pos_{i}(a) = 1$, and if $a$ is the least preferred one then $pos_{i}(a) = m$. A collection $V = (\succ_{1}, \ldots, \succ_{n})$ of agents' preference orders is called a \textit{preference profile}.
\\

If $A$ is the set of all the alternatives and $B$ is a nonempty strict subset of $A$, then by $B \succ A - B$ we mean that all alternatives in $B$ are preferred to those outside of $B$ for the preference order $\succ$.
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 2: Positional scoring function. \cite{1}} \hspace{.1in} A \textit{positional scoring function} (PSF) is a function $\alpha^{m}: [m] \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. It assigns a score to every position in the agent's preference order. If for each $i,j \in [m]$, if $i < j$ then $\alpha^{m}(i) > \alpha^{m}(j)$, a PSF $\alpha^{m}$ is a \textit{decreasing positional scoring function} (DPFS) .
\\

If $\alpha^{m}$ is a DPSF then $\alpha^{m}(i)$ can be used to represent the \textit{satisfaction} value of an agent when she is assigned to an alternative that is $i$'th in her preference order. For every DPSF $\alpha^{m}(m) = 0$, so an agent is not satisfied at all with her worst alternative. In some cases, we will write $\alpha$ instead of $\alpha^{m}$ to simplify notation.
\\

A DPSF  $\alpha^{m}$ is considered a \textit{linear satisfaction function} if for each $i \in [m-1]$ value $\alpha^{m}(i+1) - \alpha^{m}(i)$ is constant. Every DPSF not satisfying that constraint is considered a \textit{nonlinear satisfaction function}.
\\

We define a family $\alpha$ of DPSFs as $\alpha = (\alpha^{m})_{m \in \mathbb{N}}$, where $\alpha^{m}$ is a DPSF on $[m]$, such that $\alpha^{m+1}(i+1) = \alpha^{m}(i)$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and $i \in [m]$. Families of DPSFs are built iteratively by prepending values to functions with smaller domains (smaller $m$), leaving existing values from the previous function (previous family member) unchanged. Such families of DPSFs are called \textit{normal} DPSFs.
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 3: Assignment functions. \cite{1}} \hspace{.1in} We define a \textit{K-assignment function} as any function $\Phi: N \rightarrow A$ that satisfies $\norm{\Phi(N)} \leq K$ (it assigns agents to no more than $K$ alternatives). A \textit{Monroe K-assignment function} is a K-assignment function that additionally satisfies the following constraint: For each alternative $a \in A$ we have that either $\left\lfloor \frac{\norm{N}}{K} \right\rfloor \leq \norm{\Phi^{-1}(a)} \leq \left\lceil \frac{\norm{N}}{K} \right\rceil$ or $\norm{\Phi^{-1}(a)} = 0$. It means that for Monroe K-assignment function, agents are assigned to exactly $K$ alternatives and each of the alternatives has about $\frac{\norm{N}}{K}$ agents assigned.
\\

A \textit{partial K-assignment function} is similar to a K-assignment function, with one exception: it may assign an empty alternative, $\bot$, to the agents. A \textit{partial Monroe K-assignment} is a partial K-assignment that can be extended to a regular Monroe K-assignment by replacing each assignment of an empty alternative with one from $A$. If we have an assignment function $\Phi$, alternative $\Phi(i)$ is called the \textit{representative} of agent $i$.
\\

Let $S$ be a set of alternatives. By $\Phi^{S}$ we mean a (possibly partial) K-assignment function that assigns agents only to alternatives from $S$.
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 4: Total satisfaction function. \cite{1}} \hspace{.1in} We assume that $\alpha$ is a normal DPSF. Following function assigns a positive integer to a given assignment $\Phi$:
\begin{gather}
	l^{\alpha}_{sum}(\Phi) = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \alpha (pos_{i}(\Phi(i)))
\end{gather}
This function combines satisfaction of the agents to assess the quality of the assignment for the entire society. It simply calculates the sum of the individual agents satisfaction value and is used as the \textit{total satisfaction function}.
\\

For each subset of the alternatives $S \subseteq A$ that satisfies $\norm{S} \leq K$, $\Phi^{S}_{\alpha}$ denotes the partial (Monroe) K-assignment that assigns agents only to the alternatives from $S$ and such that $\Phi^{S}_{\alpha}$ maximizes the total satisfaction $l^{\alpha}_{sum}(\Phi^{S}_{\alpha})$.

\section{Monroe and Chamberlin-Courant Rules}

We will now define the problems of winner determination under the Monroe and Chamberlin-Courant (abbreviated as CC) rules. The goal is to find an optimal assignment function, where by the optimal function we accept one that maximizes the total satisfaction.
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 5: SatWinner. \cite{1}} \hspace{.1in} Let $\alpha$ be a normal DPSF. An instance of $\alpha$\textit{-CC-SatWinner} problem is defined as follows: given a set of agents $N = [n]$, a set of alternatives $A = \left\{ a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m} \right\}$, a preference profile $V$ of the agents, and positive integer $K$ representing committee size, we seek a K-assignment function $\Phi$ that maximizes $l^{\alpha}_{sum}(\Phi)$. The problem $\alpha$\textit{-Monroe-SatWinner} is defined in the same way but we additionally require $\Phi$ to be a Monroe K-assignment function.
\\

These problems' intention is to find a (Monroe) K-assignment function which returns a set of $K$ alternatives, who are viewed as the winners of the given multiwinner election (e.g. elected members of a committee).

\section{Approximate Solutions}

As for many normal IPSFs multiwinner election problems under both Monroe and Chamberlin-Courant rules are NP-hard \cite{2,3}, we are looking for approximate solutions.
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Definition 6: Approximation algorithms. \cite{1}} \hspace{.1in} Let $r$ be a real number such that $0 < r \leq 1$, let $\alpha$ be a normal DPSF, and let $R$ be either Monroe or CC. An algorithm is an \textit{r-approximation algorithm} for $\alpha$-R-SatWinner problem if on each instance $I$ it returns a feasible assignment $\Phi$ such that $l^{\alpha}_{sum}(\Phi) \geq r \cdot OPT$, where $OPT$ is the optimal total satisfaction $l^{\alpha}_{sum}(\Phi_{OPT})$.
